## Features

Basic syntax highlighting for `just` files:

- Comments
- Variable assignment and settings
- Strings & interpolation blocks
- Recipes: recipe attributes, names, params and dependencies
- Keywords, constants and operators
- Some embedded languages

Commands:

- Format on save
- Run recipe
- Task running


Demo:

-  VSCode with `just` syntax highlighting
   <img src="./assets/example.png" style="max-width: 75%;" alt="syntax highlight example" />

- GitHub syntax highlighting
    
    ```just
    # Demo

    set tempdir := "/tmp"

    export MY_VAR := `./my_script.sh`

    [confirm("Continue?")]
    @foo PARAM_1="hello" PARAM_2="world" +ARGS="":
        echo {{ PARAM_1 }} {{ PARAM_2 }} {{ ARGS }}

    python:
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        print('Hello from python!')

    ```

## Known Issues

This extension does simple and/or best effort syntax highlighting. It is not intended to be 100% comprehensive, but rather provide a good enough experience for most users. That being said, if you find a bug or missing feature, please open an issue or a pull request.

### Nesting and scoping

Since expressions can have deep nesting and we cannot tell the scope based on indentation or other markers, we run into the following issues. These are limitations of TextMate grammars and is not easily fixable. 
  
- Expression and recipe specific rules pollute the global repository scopes, meaning we apply `just` highlighting within recipe bodies. This means `just` keywords/operators/etc, like `if`, will highlight everywhere. This is necessary to highlight expressions correctly elsewhere.

- Some nested expressions will break due to lack of awareness of depth and preemptively match a closing character. Ex.

    ```just
    echo {{ '{{ string }}' }}
    ```

    will echo `{{ string }}` since braces within the string are escaped and part of the string's scope. Textmate can't handle this without a full parser, so will match on the first closing brace it finds.

- Line breaking and expressions that span multiple lines may not highlight correctly. As a simple example

    ```just
    foo param1 \
        param2='foo':
    echo {{param1}} {{param2}}
    ```

## Publishing

This extension is available on the following marketplaces:

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nefrob.vscode-just-syntax)
- [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nefrob/vscode-just-syntax)

If you are using an open source build of VSCode, you might need to install the extension manually. To do so:

1. Navigate to the latest [release](https://github.com/nefrob/vscode-just/releases) and download the `.vsix` file.
2. Copy the file to your `.vscode/extensions` directory.
3. Install via the command line: `code --install-extension .vscode/extensions/vscode-just-X.Y.Z.vsix`

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap

Outstanding:

- [ ] Update to match [just grammar](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/43d88f50e02057e5d91602ef4ffdd0ddfc094099/GRAMMAR.md) more accurately
- [ ] Improve escaping within strings

Completed:

- [x] Initial release
- [x] Update with new `just` releases
- [x] Migrate to `yaml` grammar for composability and readability
- [x] Add snapshot testing
- [x] Publish to [open source marketplaces](https://open-vsx.org/)
- [x] Format on save
- [x] Run recipe

### Beyond

- Semantic highlighting / LSP

    To avoid implementing a parser for files, it would be ideal for `just` to expose the AST or other APIs for editor extensions to leverage. This would allow for more advanced features like semantic highlighting, code folding, and more.

    If VSCode works to support tree-sitter, [that](https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just) would be a possible alternative.
